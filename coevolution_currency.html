  <h1>Coevolution Currency: A Humane Alternative</h1>
  <p>
    In a world moving rapidly toward Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), we face a profound ethical and existential dilemma. CBDCs may offer efficiency, but they also concentrate control, enabling unprecedented surveillance and manipulation of the populace. They risk turning citizens into data points—devoid of autonomy, vulnerable to state overreach.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Coevolution Currency emerges as a response rooted in compassion and decentralization. It seeks not to dominate but to connect; not to regulate from above, but to empower from within. It embodies the tears of empathy—"a single drop of sorrow"—that unite all beings who suffer in silence under systems built for profit, not people.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our currency values shared life, not consumption. It rewards acts of solidarity and recognizes the invisible labor of caregiving, community building, and emotional resilience. It is peer-validated, transparent, and deeply ethical.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Coevolution Currency may begin small, but its purpose is enormous: to awaken a civilization where dignity is not priced, and where every soul has value—beyond market utility.
